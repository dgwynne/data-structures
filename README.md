# some C data structure implementations

## tree.h

Implements common code for binary search trees in C, with both RB
and AVL "frontends" to the common code for actual maintenance of
the trees. The code is like (but not exactly the same as) the
traditional `sys/tree.h` APIs.

## heap.h

This implements a pairing heap.
